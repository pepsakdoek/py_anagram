Words_alpha.txt : 
Added english data set (from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words), which was obtained from 
https://web.archive.org/web/20131118073324/https://www.infochimps.com/datasets/word-list-350000-simple-english-words-excel-readable

So Infochimp owns the copyright (maybe, infochimps now reroute to dev.co)

Anyway, credit here
